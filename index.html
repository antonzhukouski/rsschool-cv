      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>I am currently studying the React library on my own using the official documentation.
      My friends and I have been organizing water rafting and outdoor corporate events for 350+ people for 10+ years. This lesson taught me teamwork and how to approach completely different people.
      I am interested in photography and cycling.
